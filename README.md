SGI Indy Hacking
----------------

This is a place I'm putting bits and pieces of SGI Indy software/driver
hacking and notes.

 * src/newport - where I'm fleshing out a library of newport graphics
   primitives and benchmarks.  This runs on NetBSD-11 and runs from userland
   by requesting console device access.

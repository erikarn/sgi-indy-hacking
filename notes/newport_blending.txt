Alpha / Blend Blending
----------------------

This one is TBD as I need to go read up more about what's supposed to
happen, but the TL;DR is:

 * BLEND in DRAWMODE1 needs to be set
 * To use the DDA for Alpha values you need to set COLORALPHA appropriately,
   and I do need to sit down and verify how that's programmed.
 * When blitting it in via the HOSTRW register you should use the ABGR format,
   and leave COLOURALPHA alone.
 * In theory you can combine it with the SHADE settings, but I'm nowhere
   near verifying those yet.
 * BLENDALPHA1 in DRAWMODE1 controls whether the source alpha is SFACTOR,
   or just the fixed value "1.0".
 * SFACTOR and DFACTOR implement the expected blend/alpha blend functions,
   they're documented in the REX3 PDF.
